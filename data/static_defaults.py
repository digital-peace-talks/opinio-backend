        "connection with Earth's climate. Whether these warnings are "
        "effective is not a closed case and in particular how such "
        "warnings might work is an open question needing more "
        "investigation. Reactions to warnings in the climate commons "
        "leads us through a synopsis of innate or explicit vehicles for "
        "delivering cautionary information on climate and possible "
        "mechanisms for action elicited by such communications, "
        "respectfully noting limitations of prior research on the topic. "
        "Lead author Annika Wyss and her team of coathors zero in on the "
        "powerful role our emotions seem to play in our comprehension "
        "leading to productive responses in our actual behavior, "
        "especially feelings of guilt. For those of us familiar with "
        "functional guilt as a means of combating procrastination, the "
        "authors' conclusions are not necessarily surprising:\n"
        "\n"
        "Across two studies, we investigated people's affective and "
        "behavioral reactions in response to environmental warnings in a "
        "threshold public goods game where unsustainable decisions are "
        "associated with actual CO2 externalities. We demonstrated that "
        "participants show a lasting, yet diminishing decrease in "
        "resource extraction after receiving a warning that their group "
        "would surpass a critical threshold causing a CO2 emission, "
        "should their level of extracting points remain unsustainable. "
        "Importantly, our results show that experienced guilt is "
        "consistently associated with behavioral change. More "
        "specifically, guilt mediates the effect of warnings on "
        "pro-environmental behavioral change, meaning that higher levels "
        "of guilt are predictive of a stronger reduction of resource "
        "extraction after receiving an environmental warning.\n"
        "\n"
        "At our core and as a species we're of course bent on survival, "
        'and survival needs backup mechanisms for when "normal" processes '
        "fail. Supposing that we can't feel guilty enough to face the "
        "future by behaving better, it appears we have other means of "
        "soothing our anxieties.  Avoidance, rationalization, and denial: "
        "Defensive self-protection in the face of climate change "
        "negatively predicts pro-environmental behavior by Wullenkord & "
        "Reese explores our facile competence in avoiding emotional "
        "overload by lapsing into irrational reinterpretation and "
        "analysis of facts. The authors' findings suggest that guilt goes "
        "out the window if  we can (and we do!)  construct a happy story "
        'that "it\'s not going to be that bad"  when presented with a '
        "picture so dismal that it might instead arrest us in our tracks. "
        "Instead, we hypothesize more comfortable scenarios.\n"
        "\n"
        "Wullenkord & Reese's findings smack of potential immediate "
        "relevance. Faced with a seemingly overwhelmingly challenge, the "
        "self-defensive protections they describe may be a circuit "
        "breaker tripping in enough heads to affect results in the real "
        "world, in a factually negative way that won't be wished out of "
        "existence. It's not about denial in the simple sense with which "
        "we're familiar; we can see the graveyard and yet whistle past. "
        "In enough company as a chorus this is of course detrimental to a "
        "better future. Along with the fantasy comes some baggage: we "
        "don't feel motivated to do anything concrete to improve "
        "outcomes, because of course that motivation will be in conflict "
        'with our self-constructed perceptions. "Concrete" not least '
        "means clear direction to those giving overall shape to public "
        "policy, namely legislators, who in turn direct the efforts of "
